# Flow

A light-weight social media platform. The platform is built with these purposes in mind:

    1. To learn how to work with Blazor in asp.net.
    2. To learn how to work with MongoDb.
    3. To get more experience with planning and developing an application from scratch.
    4. To practice clean architecture (again).

Another major reason for the project is to try out some lessons that I learned from my previous project, most notably to separate the Identity database from all the other data in the system -- this is expected to reduce pain by a lot.


  
## Roadmap

The project just started, so there is a lot of work to be done. Some features that I aim to implement are (not in order):

- User registration/login
- Posting content to the feed
- Viewing the feeds of other users ("world feed")
- Connecting with other users
- Viewing the feeds of friends ("friends feed")
- Feed filter
- Recursive liking of posts: Like a post, like that someone likes the post, like that someone likes that someone ...
- "Mentions" in posts
- Notifications

If I have more time:

- Instant messaging with friends
- Blocking other users
